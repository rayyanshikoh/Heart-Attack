Context

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to 
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Attribute Information: 

Data looks OK, so I can go further with analysis. Decryption on attributes from data source webpage:

age - age in years
sex - sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp - chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy)
thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)
ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
num - the predicted attribute - diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) (Value 0 = < 50% diameter narrowing; Value 1 = > 50% diameter narrowing)
